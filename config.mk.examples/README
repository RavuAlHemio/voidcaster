This directory contains examples of config.mk files. These files may be placed
in the root source directory of the Voidcaster (next to the Makefile) under the
name "config.mk" to adapt the build options to a given platform. Of course, you
may write a config.mk file yourself or adapt an existing one to the needs of
your system.
